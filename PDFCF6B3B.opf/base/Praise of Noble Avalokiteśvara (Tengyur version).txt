Homage to the Lord of the World!

Guru of all, you are honoured by the three worlds,You are lauded by leading gods, Māra and Brahmā,When
praised, you bring the highest victory of a sage—Supreme lord of the three worlds,
to you I pay homage!

Your excellent form contains countless bliss-gone buddhas.You bear the Buddha Boundless Light
at your crown.Your right hand is bountiful, dispelling the pretas' famine and drought,And
your left is perfectly adorned with a golden lotus.Your fragrant locks of hair are golden
and glistening.Your broad face is as lovely as the moon.Your lotus-eyes are supremely beautiful
and wide.Your body is as white as snow or conch and sweetly scented.You clasp a string
of immaculate, gleaming pearls.You radiate rays of dazzling light, red as the dawn.Your
arms are perfectly poised like lotuses on a lake;They are youthful and white as autumn
clouds.Your two shoulders are adorned with many jewels.Your palms are youthful and as gentle
as a leaf.Your left breast is draped with a deerskin.You are adorned with earrings, bracelets
and anklets.You rest upon a supreme, unsullied lotus.Your navel is as soft as a lotus
petal.Your golden anklets jingle merrily at your feet;[1]Your supreme golden belt is jewel-encrusted.Your
waist is girdled with a garment of finest cloth.You transcend the great
ocean with the supreme knowledge of a sage.You have amassed abundant merit and attained pre-eminence.You
banish old age and sickness and are a wellspring of eternal joy.You bring
the three to an end[2] and display celestial action.You are supreme among the embodied, triumphant
over demonic hordes.You create beauty[3] through the four brahma abodes.You move
with swan-like grace and elephantine majesty.You have gathered the accumulations and reveal
all dharmas.[4]You liberate from the sea of suffering and ocean of afflictions.[5]

Whoever rises regularly at the break of dawn,Devotedly brings Lord Avalokiteśvara to mind,And
eulogizes him with these supreme praisesWill, no matter whether they be male or female,Find
that both in this world and in all future lives,All their needs, mundane and transcendent,
are fulfilled!

This concludes the Praise of Noble Avalokiteśvara by Bhikṣuṇī Lakṣmī.
