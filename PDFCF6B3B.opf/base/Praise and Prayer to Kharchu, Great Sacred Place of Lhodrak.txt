Praise and Prayer to Kharchu, Great Sacred Place of Lhodrak

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Namo guru padmarājāya!

Like a second Akaniṣṭha transported to this world,This great vajra place of Lhodrak KharchuWas
blessed repeatedly by the Lotus-born master of Oḍḍiyāna and consort,As well as the disciples
— the king and subjects—, the vidyādharas of India,And many learned and accomplished
masters,Especially Namkhai Nyingpo, who gained accomplishmentDirectly through Viśuddha-JālaśaṃvaraAnd
attained miraculous powers, realization and the highest view.[1]Millions upon
millions of vīras and ḍākinīs,Like an abundance of sesame seeds, revel and delightIn this
supremely sacred place,Which is visible to the eye.For those of us with good karma and fortune,There
is the wondrous vajra cave with its domed ceiling —Perfectly elegant, solid and
enduring yet spontaneously formed,And its images of the symbols of the three roots,Blazing
with splendour, imbued with the blessings of the three secrets.Fields and meadows resemble
a maṇḍala of turquoiseWith divine flowers, all vividly bright and colourful.Various trees
sway in the breeze,And are laden with finest fruit.Heavenly birds call out in sweetest
song,And nectar-like water possessing the eight qualitiesGently cascades and flows in streams.There
are male and female yogis and holders of awareness,Visible and invisible, too numerous
to count,And inexhaustible Dharma riches and profound treasures —To this great place
of abundant accomplishment,I pray: inspire me with your blessings!Supreme vajra place,
Devīkoṭa,[2]Through infusing this practitioner's body,And gathering outer, inner and other
as one,Cause me to gain control of energy-mind and appearances,Delight the gathering of vīras
and ḍākinīs,And actualise the level of Yangdak-Cakrasaṃvara!

The vidyādhara Kunzang Ösal Nyingpo Tsal prayed in this way on the 20th day of the monkey month
of the Fire Monkey year[3] while passing through this very place. Siddhirastu!
