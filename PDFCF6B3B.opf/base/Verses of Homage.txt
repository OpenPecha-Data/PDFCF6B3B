Verses of Homage

by Kyabjé Trulshik Rinpoche

Oṃ Svasti!With merit and wisdom gathered over countless ages as the cause,You gained the result
— the ten strengths and four fearlessnesses of buddhahood.Great guide of this fortunate
age, appearing with the signs and marks of perfection,Siddhārtha, you who fulfilled your
every aim, grant us virtue and excellence!

Amid the splendour of a hundred rays of light from Amitābha‘s heart,You were born on the tip
of a lotus stem upon the lake of Sindhu,And came as a second buddha to the Land of Snows
—Lotus-born guru Padmākara, grant us your protection at all times!

Embodiment of all the buddhas’ compassion, holder of the white lotus,Having set aside the apparel
of the saṃbhogakāya,You appear as a monk in saffron robes to protect this world,Victorious
lord Tenzin Gyatso, in heartfelt devotion, we bow to you!

In response to requests by the Rigpa Sangha of Lerab Ling in France, this was written and offered
from Nepal by the one called Dzarong Shadeu Trulshik, Ngawang Chökyi Lodrö, in the Tibetan
year 2133, the Fire Dog, on the 26th day of the 4th month (21 June, 2006).
