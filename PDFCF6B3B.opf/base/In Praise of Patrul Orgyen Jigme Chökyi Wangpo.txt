In Praise of Patrul Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo
by Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima

chi nang rik shyung gyatsö parol sön
You traversed the ocean of knowledge of the outer and inner sciences
zabgyé sung rab mangpö drom chik gyur
To become a repository of manifold teachings, profound and vast.
wenpé né su kutsé drub la dril
In solitary places, you devoted your entire life to practice,
tukdam shyal zik changchub sem nyi jong
Saw the yidam deities in visions and mastered twofold bodhicitta.

chö gyé ronyom bepé tulshyuk dzé
You realized the equal taste of the eight worldly concerns and practised as a hidden yogin;
dik chö yulkham karpö ling du gyur
You transformed a land of unwholesome action into a sanctuary of the virtuous;
changchub chöpé lamzang chok gyar pel
You promoted the excellent path of bodhisattva conduct in a hundred directions;
sang chen gyü gyal tsémö ten sok zung
And you maintained the life-force of the ultimate teachings of the great secret king of tantras.

orgyen jikme chökyi wangpo la
While thus recalling your life of liberation,
namtar dren shyin depé solwa deb
I pray to you, Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo:
di chi bardo küntu tukjé zung
Hold me with compassion in this life, the next and the bardo state,
gongmé gyü sol zinpar jingyi lob
And inspire me to uphold the lineage of the great masters of the past.

Tenpai Nyima wrote these words for his own recitation.
