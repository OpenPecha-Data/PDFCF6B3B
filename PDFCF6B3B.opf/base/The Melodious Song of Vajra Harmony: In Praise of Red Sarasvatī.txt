The Melodious Song of Vajra Harmony

In Praise of Red Sarasvatī

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ sarasvati hrīṃ

Manifestation of all the conquerors’s speech,The thought of whom grants longevity, wisdom,Merit
and the most supreme intelligence—Red Sarasvatī, to you I offer homage and praise.

Red as a ruby,With a face of beauty and captivating form,The mere glimpse of which is never
enough—Mother of the victorious ones, to you I offer praise.

With the powerful king of jewels,You bring down rains of all that is desirable,And in the clear
surface of the mirror you holdExistence and quiescence are reflected—to you I offer praise.


Nurturer of naturally present wisdom,The immaculate sourceOf qualities seen and unseen—Scarlet
songstress, to you I offer praise.

You utterly eradicate the darkWhich lingers in the heartAfter scant visualization of your formAnd
recitation of your mantra—to you I offer praise.

Grant me, I pray, the confidence and intellectTo master the meaning of the oceanic teachingsAnd
the outer and inner sciences, includingGrammar, logic, poetry, composition, and astrology.


Make me unhindered in exposition, debate and composition,Unblock the eight channels to wisdom,Such
as the swift, powerful insight into the profound and vast,And release the eight treasures
of courageous eloquence.[1]

From now until I attain awakening,May I always meet a genuine teacher,Expand the wisdom light
of twofold knowledge,And have the capacity to serve the teachings.

Through the blessings of Mañjuśrī,May brilliant orange light shine outTo banish the darkness
that besets teachings and beings,And bring about the youthful wonder of virtue and excellence.


By the light of the moon and a precious electric lamp during the first session of the night
on the third 'excellence' of the waxing phase of the month of victory,[2] while travelling
by boat along the Ganges, Tsuklak Lungrik Nyima Mawé Sengé wrote down and prayed whatever
came to mind. Vījayantu. Maṅgalam.
