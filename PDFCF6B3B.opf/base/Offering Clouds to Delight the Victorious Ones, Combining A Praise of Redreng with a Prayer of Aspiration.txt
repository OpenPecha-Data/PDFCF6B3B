Offering Clouds to Delight the Victorious Ones, Combining A Praise of Redreng with a Prayer
of Aspiration

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Namo guru śākyamunaye!

Sun-like conqueror, protector of the triple world,Lord of Sages, Maitreya, Mañjughoṣa,Holder
of the White Lotus, Tārā and the rest—This great pleasure grove delights them all:It is a
pleasant site where noble beings reside,Perfectly arranged and with a fragrant scent,And
thickly arrayed groves of medicinal plants,Various species of emanated birds who call out
in song,Gently flowing streams of water possessing the eight qualities,Grassy meadows arrayed
like a maṇḍala of turquoise,All filled with beautiful flowers that delight both gods and
men,And where precious stones and minerals gleam and glisten.Ḍākinīs and vīras sing like
the humming of bees.Sages, vidyādharas and siddhas throng like sesame seeds.Here they reside
in this place that is like just SukhāvatīTransposed to earth, wondrous in its power to
inspire.Onto this great stage, which delights everyone including the gods,Came the one true
heart-son of Atiśa Dīpaṃkāra,Who was the actual manifestation of Amitābha freed from the
lotus,The great Gyalwé Jungné, ‘Source of the Conquerors’, Könchok Bang,[1]Through his
blessing this great temple where MañjughoṣaIs directly present, this supreme support for all
the world,Arose as the splendour and merit of people from the snowy peaks.

Kyema![2]This is the great heavenly realm of Akaniṣṭha,With precious trees in the four cardinal
and eight intermediate directions,[3]Bringing delight to countless buddhas and bodhisattvas,Whose
smiles are enhanced through the latticed rays of light.Nectar-like treasures dispel
sickness, harmful influences, negative actions and obscurations.Jewel-like cliffs and
terraces are beautifully arrangedAnd entirely filled with caches of Dharma and other riches.


This great pleasure grove that delights the victorious onesIs equal to the divine assembly hall
of Excellent Dharma.[4]The Mañjuvajra is like a newly risen sun[5]Shining upon a mountain
of saffronOne never tires of looking upon it, as it blazes with the splendour of the signs
and marksAnd appears as the great all-pervasive lord of all existence and quiescence.The
magical emanation of Gyalwa Könchok Bang,Gyalwé Jungné, brings joy upon sight,With a retinue
of countless emanations of noble ones of the three familiesAppearing in succession
like a chain of golden mountains.These supreme representations, blessed by the victorious
one’s secret body, speech and mind,Are amassed here like a mountain of precious jewels.This
support for the merit of all the world’s inhabitantsIs like the splendour of the two perfected
accumulations.

Those in saffron robes gather here like flocks of geeseAnd are undistracted in their tenfold
practice of Dharma.They are peaceful, disciplined and conscientious,Worthy of reverence by
gods and human beings alike.

I pray that this site of support and supported, lowland and peak,May never decline for as long
as it remains,And that it may forever be secure, just like the Vajra Seat![6]

Bringing to mind all the virtues that I and others accumulateThroughout the past, present and
future,As a great cloud of offerings to delight the victorious ones,I dedicate it all as
a cause for the flourishing of the teachings.

Throughout all my births and in all my future lifetimes,May I uphold the pure conduct of the
Kadampas.May Lord Atiśa and his heirs remain upon the lotus in my heart,And may I meet them
all continually—in actuality, in visions and in dreams!

Sustained by the nectar of the teaching of the supreme vehicle,May whatever I do through the
three doors of my body, speech and mind,Be of benefit to my mothers and fathers, all sentient
beings,And may I remain until saṃsāra itself is emptied.

May all those with a connection to me, even those who merely hear my name,Be thoroughly liberated
from the seas of misery that are the lower realms.May the seed of liberation be implanted
in their minds,And may they ultimately attain the fruition of great awakening!

May the teachings of the omniscient conqueror flourish and spread,May the lives of the holders
of the teachings be secure,May all the world enjoy virtue, goodness and prosperity,And
may all the strife of these discordant times be pacified!

Thus, having reached my sixty-third year and arrived at Redreng in the North, the hermitage
of the conqueror,[7] I, Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, made this heartfelt, respectful prayer. I pray
that through inspiration and blessing, it may be realized!
