In Praise of the Protector Mañjughoṣa
by Mipham Rinpoche

tsenpé palbar yi ong shyönnü ku
Your beautiful and youthful body blazes in splendour with the major and minor marks,
tsang yang sung gi zabgyé chö tsul drok
Your speech proclaims the profound and vast Dharma in the divine voice of Brahmā,
khyenpa nyiden mikmé nyingjé tuk
And your mind possesses non-referential compassion endowed with twofold wisdom—
gönpo jampé yang la chaktsal lo
Protector Mañjughoṣa, to you I pay homage!

Dhīḥ wrote this one morning during the Iron Pig year (1911).  Virtue!
