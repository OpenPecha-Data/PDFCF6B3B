Praise of the Lords of the Three Families

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti!

You dispel the darkness of wrong view,And open the lotus of perfect intellect,Seeing all knowable
things as they truly are –Mañjughoṣa, to you I pay homage!

With great love, you look upon us,And bring freedom from suffering's shackles,Always acting
for beings' welfare –Great Compassionate One, to you I pay homage!

You wield the vajra weapon in your hand,And eliminate all the evil hosts of māra,You are the
powerful, the wrathful –Vajrapāṇi, to you I pay homage!

Through the virtue of offering this praiseTo the master-protectors of the three families,May
I and all other sentient beingsAttain the level of enlightenment!
