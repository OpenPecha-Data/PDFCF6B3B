The White Lotus: In Praise of Lumbinī

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti!The great flag of your universal renownFlies high throughout the three worlds,You
of supreme marks and moon-like face[1] —Lord of sages, to you I pay homage!

Following five wondrous considerations,You, the divine Prince Śvetaketu,Took birth in this world
of ours in Kapilavastu,As the son of Śuddhodana.You blessed the golden womb of Mahāmāyā,[2]As
a jewelled palace,Where you taught the Dharma.And when months equal in number to
the ten bhūmisHad passed, you emerged painlesslyAs a newborn from her right side,To be wrapped
in white cottonBy the gods Brahmā and Indra.When you then took seven stepsPure fresh
lotuses sprang upAnd blossomed beneath your feet,And a great radiance filled the air.You were
bathed in divine nectar,A prognosticator examined you wellAnd prophesied that you would
becomeEither a universal monarch or a buddha.At this, the gods raised their eyebrowsAnd
laughed together in merriment,While Māra’s hosts despondently cried outAnd wailed in anguish.At
once, countless signs of merit and fortuneAppeared throughout the world,As your five
hundred positive aspirationsFor this age of strife took effect.Thereafter, as a great leader
of beings,You excelled in the sports and games of youth,Reached the essence of enlightenment,And
perfectly sounded the great Dharma drum.As I behold this renowned and sacred site,Venerated
by so many noble arhats,A place that truly liberates upon seeing,I bow down in
faith and devotion.

Through the virtue of offering praise in this way,May there be boundless perfecting, maturing
and purifyingThroughout infinite, ocean-like realms, so that beings are freedAnd attain
the supreme status, equal to this Great Sage!

When encountering this very place, I, Jampal Gawé Gocha, felt inspired to arrange these flower-like
words.
