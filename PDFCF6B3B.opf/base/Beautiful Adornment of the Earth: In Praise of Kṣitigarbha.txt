Svā. Kṣitigarbha, Essence of the Earth, you who nurture all beings,
sa shyi shyindu nam mang yönten ten
Like the underlying ground, you support qualities of many kinds,

Like a wish-granting gem, you fulfil the hopes of the three worlds.

Lord of the ten bhūmis, to you I offer homage and praise.

From stage to stage you lead, establishing at the level of the victorious,
sachü tsimen lotok gyün pel shying
Like the earth’s nourishing essence that yields a steady flow of produce,
sa di nam mang jorpé yong kangwé
This earth that is replete with riches and many forms of bounty—
sa yi lha chok khyö la chaktsal tö
To you, supreme deity of the earth, I offer homage and praise.

bumzang paksam shing dang dzokden trin
You are like an excellent vase, a wish-fulfilling tree,
dütsi chu tso jishyin gang gi khyö
Clouds of perfection, or a lake of healing nectar:
drenpa dé la pal du lek nepa
To think of you brings lasting splendour and magnificence.
tukjé daknyi khyö la chaktsal tö
Embodiment of compassion, to you I offer homage and praise.

With supreme qualities of the infinite victors and their heirs,
namkha dzö kyi ngadak khyö chikpu
You alone are the sovereign lord of the treasury of space,
gyalsé tsul gyi tayé shying nam su
And in the realms of the bodhisattvas’ limitless ways,
gyalwé dzepa tadak kyong la dü
You uphold the victorious buddhas’ activity—to you I bow.

pakmé yönten norbü özer gyi
With the jewel-like rays of your boundless qualities,
nyikmé güpa tadak tendu nyil
You overwhelm all faults and failings in this degenerate time,
püntsok dé shyi pal gyi ngön towé
And promote the glory of fourfold wellbeing.1
lab chen trinlé dzé la chaktsal tö
To you who perform great waves of enlightened action, I offer homage and praise.

jamyang jikten wangchuk kuntuzang
Through many aeons of multifaceted veneration and prayer
mipampa sok gyalsé sempa chok
To Mañjughoṣa, Lokeśvara,2 Samantabhadra,
nam mang kalpar chö ching soltab lé
Ajita3 and the rest—supreme bodhisattva heirs of the victorious ones,
khyö chik yütsam drenpé rendö nam
Now, for an instant, I think of you alone.

yishyin tsol la khyepar pak shyé su
You, who are pre-eminent in the fulfilment of all wishes,
gyalwé ngakpa gyalsé tuwo chok
And were thus praised by the victorious ones as foremost of their heirs.
gyalwa nam dang yermé khyö töpé
Through extolling you as inseparable from the buddhas,
dak la ji dö pal nam lek tsol dzö
May you grant the excellent splendour of everything I wish for and desire!

sa sum dro di depé tob nyé ching
May beings throughout the three worlds discover the strength of faith;
sa yi wangchuk khyi kyi jesu dzin
May they be guided by you, the powerful lord of the earth;
sachü pal pel sateng dewé khyab
May the earth’s nourishing powers increase and happiness pervade the world;
sa né sar drö sa chok drubpar shok
And may we progress from stage to stage and reach the level that is supreme!

Mipham Jampal Gyepa arranged these verses, which are as numerous as the eight auspicious substances,
on the 27th (also known as ‘the band’)4 of the eighth month of the Fire Horse year.5
May virtue and excellence increase!
