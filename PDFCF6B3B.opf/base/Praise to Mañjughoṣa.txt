Praise to Mañjughoṣa

by Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa

Svasti.Your form is as beautiful as the glowing golden clouds of a fresh dawn,Your speech as
sweet as the melodious voice of the immortal lord,[1]Your mind as deep as the great liquid
treasury of the sea —Mañjughoṣa, father of the victorious, I bow to you in homage.

To you, who for infinite aeons in infinite realmsStrove boundlessly to listen to countless teachingsFrom
countless victorious ones, ultimately to becomeThe lord of incomparable knowledge,
I bow.

To you, who for as long as saṃsāra enduresWill remain to safeguard all careworn beings,Peerless
lord of compassion, undauntedBy the great burdens of sentient beings, I bow.

Through setting down here, however inadequately,A mere droplet from the ocean of wondrous deedsPerformed
by the foremost bodhisattva in all realmsFor the sake of beings whose number
is as vast as space,

May the venerable Mañjughoṣa always be a guideRevealing the supreme vehicle in every lifetime,
andMay he free the kind ones immersed in misery’s oceanSo that all may come to resemble
Mañjughoṣa himself.
