Homage to Milarepa
by Nāropa

jangchok münpé makrum na
In the darkness of the lands to the North
gang la nyima shar drawé
Is one just like a snow-capped peak in the rising sun,
töpa ga shyé jawa yi
He who is known as Töpa Ga, 'Joyous to Hear,'
kyebu dé la chaktsal lo
To that great being, I pay homage!

Nāropa spontaneously sang this praise to Milarepa.
