Praise to Sakya Paṇḍita

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Oṃ svasti!Glorious one who overcomes the two obscurationsAnd spontaneously fulfils the two aims—Gentle
Voice,Source of splendour and most splendid of all,Mañjughoṣa guru, to you I offer
homage.

Light rays of universal joy, delightful to behold,You raise the banner of victory for the Sage’s
teachings,And possess the wisdom of perfect knowledge and love,Excellent one, at your
feet I pay homage.

Mañjughoṣa, may the sweet nectarFrom your compassion’s lunar light,Cause the lily petals of
my intellect to open,And may you dwell within the lotus at my heart.

May the great light from the sun of your three secretsDispel the delusion hidden deep within
my heart,And the sharp blade of your realization of selflessness,Tear through the entangled
web of my view of self.

Help me to imbibe with insight and diligenceThe vast ocean of the Victorious One’s words,And
help me to realize precisely and unerringlyTheir genuine definitive meaning and essential
points.

Throughout the entire series of my lives to come,May you, Mañjughoṣa guru, always care for me.Never
omit me from your compassionate embrace,But protect me from the ills of existence
and peace.

Thus, the youthful Dharmamati prayed with intense faith and devotion. Siddhi bhavatu! Maṅgalam.
