Homage to the Deity!

drowé lama chomden mitrukpa
Guru of beings, Bhagavān Akṣobhya,
tukjé chenpö drowa jezung bé
You perfected the aspiration to guide beings with great compassion,
mönlam tarchin changchub chok nyepa
And attained supreme enlightenment—
kyob dzé drowé gön la chaktsal lo
Guardian and protector of beings, to you I offer homage!

langpo pema nyimé den teng na
Upon a throne supported by elephants and a lotus and sun-disc,
baidurya yi dok dra tsenpé gyen
You sit with a body the color of lapis lazuli, adorned with marks and signs.
kyil trung nyam shyak sa nön chakgya chen
Your legs are crossed, and hands are poised in the earth-touching mudrā and gesture of equanimity.
namdak ku nga dé la chaktsal lo
To you whose body is utterly pure, I offer homage!

nyi kyi tuk lé özer rab tröpé
Your heart radiates rays of light,
drowé dukngal malü nam jang né
Which purify all the sufferings of beings without exception.
lamé sa la göpé nyen chikpu
To the one and only friend who leads to the supreme state,
yönten dzokpar dzé la chaktsal lo
The one who has perfected enlightened qualities, I offer homage!

khyö kyi ku sung tuk dang semchen nam
Your enlightened body, speech and mind are never separate from sentient beings,
yermé chikpé tsen tsam töpa yang
So even merely to hear your name
nyé tsok pang né tsang gyar dön mi za
Removes all faults and brings enlightenment—of this there is no doubt.
chaktsal kyab su chi o kyab tu sol
To you I offer homage, in you I take refuge: please grant me your protection!
