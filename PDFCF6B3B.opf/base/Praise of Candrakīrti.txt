Praise of Candrakīrti

by Khenpo Shenpen Nangwa

Born as an emanation of Mañjuśrī,Who understood the intent of Nāgārjuna,Guru known as Candrakīrti,
'Famous as the Moon',To you I pay homage.

Glorious Candrakīrti,Through the power of pure ethical discipline,You caused a tree to sprout
from charred groundAnd grow to its full size—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious Candrakīrti,You milked painted milch cowsTo stop the clinging to realityIn others'
minds—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou transmitted the grammatical treatise Wholly Excellent (Samantabhadra)And
with the flow of the GangesCaused wisdom to expand—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou summoned a mighty lion of stoneAnd averted the Turuṣka armyWithout death
or injury—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou debated the learned CandragominFor a period of seven years,Yet still
could not be defeated—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiBy means of the lion's roar of genuine reasoning,You struck fear into all
oxen-like philosophers,Buddhist and non-Buddhist—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou correctly elucidated the fundamental viewOf Nāgārjuna and his heir,[1]Unfathomed
by a thousand other scholars—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou illuminated the entire worldWith Prāsaṅgika works of ultimate, definitive
meaning,Which refute mistaken assertions—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou saw the approach of fact-based reasoning,And followed the tradition
of the supreme scholar Bhāviveka—A great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou analyzed with the six limits[2]The great secret mantra vehicle,And taught
the swift path—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious CandrakīrtiYou realized the supreme secret, the vajra essence,And in a subtle form
of great transference,Transcended birth and death—a great wonder indeed.

Glorious Candrakīrti,With impartial and unbounded compassion,You liberate beings until the very
ends of time—A great wonder indeed.

Glorious Candrakīrti,Merely hearing your nameDispels the darkness of ignorance throughout all
livesAnd confers wisdom—a great wonder indeed.

All who pray to you, the loving guide,Whose mind is one of compassion,Will remain unharmed by
fires and floods.How could storm winds ever touch them?

Through offering praise with versesOf wonder in this way, may I and all other beingsBecome your
followersAnd realize emptiness.
