In Praise of the Goddess Mārīcī
by Jigme Lingpa

om, lhamo özer chenma la chaktsal lo
Oṃ! Homage to the goddess Mārīcī!
chaktsal dü kyi dü dra chenmo
Homage to her, the great enemy of the māras!
shyen gyi mitub nampar jomma
Utterly invincible, vanquisher of all,
nyima dawé dün né dro shying
She who travels before the sun and moon,
chusin gyaltsen nampar tröma
And drives away Makaradhvaja, God of Desire—
khyö la solwa tabpa tsam gyi
Simply by praying to you,
dra yi pung ni nampar chom shik
May the hosts of opposing forces be destroyed!
sé dang yé dang tré mong jerwé
Slay them, divide them, drive them away, confuse them and disperse them,
chok lé namgyal ngödrub tsol chik
And grant us the siddhi of total victory over all adversity!

The vidyādhara Jigdral Lingpa1 wrote this in order to bring protection from fear in these turbulent
times.
